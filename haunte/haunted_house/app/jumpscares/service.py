"""Jumpscares: planned at game start, fired by the sweeper, triggered by trap objects.

Everything is decided on the server and stored in ``jumpscare_events``:
* ``plan_for_team`` picks N random moments spread over the game (and distinct artwork);
* ``fire_due`` fires them when the time comes, respecting a per-team cooldown, and only while the
  team is playing and the game is running;
* ``trigger_trap`` fires one for a single player when a trap object is touched.

A jumpscare is a pure *presentation* event: nothing here reads or writes puzzle, object, vault,
hint or timer state, so a scare can never solve, reset or change anything.
