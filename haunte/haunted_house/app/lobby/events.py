"""Lobby events.

Every meaningful change is (a) written to the ``game_events`` audit table inside the same
transaction as the change and (b) announced on an in-process bus *after* the commit.
Phase 2 has no subscribers; Phase 3 will subscribe the WebSocket layer here, so REST handlers
and WebSocket handlers never duplicate state logic.
