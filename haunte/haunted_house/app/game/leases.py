"""In-memory object leases: at most ONE player per team investigates an object at a time.

A lease is short (``OBJECT_LOCK_LEASE_SECONDS``) and renewed by a heartbeat while the player is
actually working on the object. Closed tabs and dropped connections therefore free the object by
themselves when the lease runs out (the sweeper collects expired leases). Leases are deliberately NOT
persisted: after a server restart every object is simply available again, and solved objects stay
solved because that lives in the database.

Every method takes ``now`` explicitly so tests never have to sleep. The registry is thread-safe; the
gameplay service additionally serialises each team's changes with a per-team lock.
